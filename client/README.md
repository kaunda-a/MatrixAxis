 UI Features You Can Implement with CamouFox:
Browser Fingerprint Masking

UI Control: Allow users to toggle on/off various fingerprinting features (e.g., spoofing WebGL, Fonts, Canvas, etc.).
Implementation: Create UI elements to enable/disable specific anti-fingerprinting features based on what the underlying CamouFox repo supports.
User-Agent Customization

UI Control: Let users input or select different user-agents. You can implement a list of pre-configured Firefox user-agents and allow the user to choose or rotate between them.
Implementation: Add an option where users can manually set a user-agent string or select a random one from a list each time a request is made.
Proxy Integration

UI Control: Allow users to input proxy details (e.g., IPs, ports, authentication) so they can mask their IP address or rotate proxies.
Implementation: Use CamouFox's proxy handling capabilities or integrate with proxy rotation APIs, and allow the user to manage proxy configurations.
Request Frequency and Timing

UI Control: Create options to adjust how frequently requests are made or to randomize the time intervals between requests to simulate more human-like activity.
Implementation: Add settings for request delay, random intervals, or interval jitter.
UI to Start/Stop Crawling:

UI Control: Users can start or stop the crawling process, and you can allow them to configure which websites or pages to target.
Implementation: A basic start/stop button for crawling, with an option to input a target URL and crawl depth.
Randomized Web Interactions

UI Control: Allow users to set up the randomness of interactions such as clicking, scrolling, and typing. This would make the automated interaction feel less robotic.
Implementation: Provide settings to control the frequency of clicks and scrolling actions, possibly using pre-configured patterns.
Custom JavaScript Tweaks

UI Control: Add an option to inject custom JavaScript into the page, which can mask or modify browser features (e.g., navigator.webdriver, navigator.languages).
Implementation: A text field where users can enter JavaScript code to be executed in the browser context.
Example Features for Your CamouFox UI:
Here’s how some of these UI features might look and work in practice:

User-Agent Rotation

Dropdown or input box for user to manually select or input custom user-agent strings.
Option to rotate user-agent on every request or at regular intervals.
Proxy Management

A field to input proxy addresses or select from a list of proxies.
Option to rotate proxies automatically or manually.
Simulation Settings

Toggle buttons for enabling/disabling Canvas Fingerprint Spoofing, WebGL Fingerprint Spoofing, etc.
Randomization controls for request timings or interaction delays.
Start/Stop Crawling

A simple control interface that lets the user start the crawling process and monitor progress.
Allow the user to choose multiple sites or set crawl frequency.
Example Workflow:
Setup Screen:

Users open the UI and input their target URL.
They configure options like user-agent, proxy settings, and enable/disable fingerprint masking.
Optionally, the user can set the crawl depth or frequency of interactions (random delays, scroll behavior, etc.).
Execution Screen:

The user starts the crawling process. The UI shows ongoing progress, such as pages being crawled and any detected issues (e.g., bot detection).
The user can stop the crawling anytime and check logs for any errors or detections.
Limitations & Considerations:
Browser Limitation: Since CamouFox works only with Firefox, your UI won't support browser switching (e.g., rotating between Chromium and WebKit). If you need to support this functionality, you would have to integrate other tools (like Playwright or Selenium) and provide that feature outside of CamouFox’s core repo.

Automation Control: You can only control what is exposed in the CamouFox repo. If you need to implement something beyond this, like rotating between browsers, you would need to implement additional features outside of CamouFox or fork and modify the repo.

Proxy Management: While CamouFox may support proxy configuration, you may want to integrate more advanced proxy handling if you plan on scaling the crawling process.
